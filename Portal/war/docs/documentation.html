<h2>HelloWorld in Java</h2>

<p>Requirements</p>

<p>Download the Tools package and extract it to a folder of your choice. The
destination folder has to bee in your PATH variable. You can check this by
executing <code>twospot.py -h</code> in the command line. If the command is found
and you see the twospot.py help information, everythin is ok.</p>

<p>The folder structure for the HelloWorld application is created by using the
twospot.py tools script. The command <code>twospot.py --createApplication
HelloWorld --type java</code> crates the folder structure for a java application named
HelloWorld.</p>

<p>The genrated folder structure looks very similar to a standard java web
application. The only difference lies in the app.yaml configuration file. This
file contains platform specific configuration settings.</p>
